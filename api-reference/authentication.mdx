# Authentication

The Rulebook Company API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard](https://app.rulebook.company/settings/api).

## API Keys

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control.
</Warning>

## Authentication Method

Authentication to the API is performed via Bearer token in the request header. Provide your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.rulebook.company/v1/endpoint \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Request Format

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```
