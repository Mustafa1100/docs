## Get started in three simple steps

Start consuming real-time exchange rules, fee schedules, and order type data from 40+ trading venues.

### Step 1: Explore Sample Data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Download sample datasets">
    Before integrating, explore our sample data to understand the structure:

    1. Visit [rulebookcompany.com](https://rulebookcompany.com)
    2. Click **"Download Sample Data"**
    3. Review the CSV/JSON files to understand our data schema
    4. Examine exchange rules, fee schedules, and order types

    <Tip>Sample data includes real market microstructure information from major exchanges like NYSE, NASDAQ, CME, and more.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="table" title="Understand the data structure">
    Our market microstructure data includes:

    - **Exchange Rules**: Trading hours, lot sizes, tick sizes, circuit breakers
    - **Fee Schedules**: Maker/taker fees, tiered pricing, rebates
    - **Order Types**: Supported order types per venue (limit, market, stop, etc.)
    - **Symbology**: Product listings and ticker mappings
    - **Regulatory Changes**: Historical tracking of rule modifications

    <Note>All data is provided in machine-readable formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet) optimized for algorithmic consumption.</Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Get API Access

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Create your account">
    1. Contact [support@rulebook.company](mailto:support@rulebook.company) to request access
    2. Provide your firm name and use case
    3. Receive your API credentials via secure email
    4. Review pricing and data licensing terms

    <Tip>Enterprise trials are available for qualified institutional trading firms.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="key" title="Secure your API credentials">
    Once you receive your credentials:

    1. Store your API key in a secure environment (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
    2. **Never** commit API keys to version control
    3. Rotate keys periodically per your firm's security policy
    4. Use separate keys for development and production environments

    <Warning>Treat API keys like passwords - they provide access to licensed market data.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Make Your First API Call

<Accordion icon="code" title="Retrieve exchange fee data">
  Use your API key to fetch current fee schedules for a specific exchange:

  ```bash
  curl https://api.rulebook.company/v1/exchanges/NASDAQ/fees \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```

  **Example Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "exchange": "NASDAQ",
    "effective_date": "2024-01-01",
    "fee_schedule": {
      "maker_fee": -0.0002,
      "taker_fee": 0.0003,
      "tier_thresholds": {
        "tier_1": { "volume": 1000000, "maker_rebate": -0.00025 },
        "tier_2": { "volume": 5000000, "maker_rebate": -0.0003 }
      }
    },
    "last_updated": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
